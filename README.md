# Personal Website: Template
This is a template for the Hack Club "Boba Drops" program being run as our first workshop session.

Welcome, club members! This is a simple template for your personal site if you've never touched HTML or CSS before. We'll be going through how to set up your own personal site using this template. Each file in this repository is a different part of the site, and includes comments explaining what each part does and how you can change it.

## How do I get started?
1. Visit [this link](https://github.com/new/import) to create a new repository. Name it `[yourusername].github.io` under "Your new repository details" **(this part is important!)** and enter `https://github.com/Runshaw-Hack-Club/PersonalSite-Template` as the source repository, and click "Begin Import"
2. Click [this link](https://github.com/codespaces/new?skip_quickstart=true&machine=basicLinux32gb&ref=main&geo=EuropeWest) to launch a codespace. This will be your editor. Choose the repository you just created, leave everything else as default, and click the blue button
3. Watch the "Using VSCode" section of the powerpoint
4. Get started with editing the site! The files are on the left side of the editor, and you can see the site by clicking the "Go Live" button on the bottom right of the editor.

## I want to start from scratch!
That's great, and you'll learn a lot from doing this! If you want to start from scratch, you won't need the template repository. Instead, you can create a new repository and create the files yourself. Here's what you'll need to know:
- You'll still need to give your new repository the same name even if you're starting from scratch: `[yourusername].github.io`
- `index.html` is the main file for your site. This is what people will see when they visit your site.
- Google is your friend! If you're not sure how to do something, try searching for it. There are a lot of resources out there to help you such as [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)
